# PtrHash Benchmarks

This folder contains comprehensive performance benchmarks for the PtrHash minimal perfect hash function implementation, comparing both the native Rust interop version and the C# port against standard data structures.

## Overview

PtrHash is a minimal perfect hash function (MPHF) that maps n distinct keys to {0,...,n-1} bijectively. These benchmarks measure:
- Query throughput (lookups per second)
- Construction time
- Memory usage
- Comparison against standard Dictionary<TKey,TValue>

## Available Benchmarks

### 1. Interop vs Port Comparison (`interop-vs-port`)
**File**: `PtrHashInteropVsPortBenchmark.cs`

Compares the native Rust interop implementation against the C# port implementation:
- Native PtrHash point and stream lookups
- C# Port PtrHash point and stream lookups
- Uses FxHasher for consistent comparison

### 2. Dictionary Comparisons (`dictionaries`)
**File**: `PtrHashDictionariesVsDictionaryBenchmark.cs`

Compares PtrHash dictionary implementations against standard Dictionary:
- Standard Dictionary<ulong, ulong> (baseline)
- Native PtrHash dictionary with sentinel values
- C# Port PtrHash dictionary implementation

### 3. Construction Time (`construct`)
**File**: `ConstructionBenchmark.cs`

Measures construction time for building PtrHash instances across different sizes.

### 4. Prefetch Performance (`prefetch`)
**File**: `PrefetchBenchmark.cs`

Tests the effectiveness of prefetching for memory-bound operations.

**Construction Time per Key:**
- Native: 17-24 ns/key (within paper target of 20-62 ns/key)
- Port: 122-228 ns/key (2-11x slower than paper target)

**Key Findings:**
- **Native construction meets paper targets** consistently
- **Port construction significantly slower** due to managed memory overhead
- Port shows high memory allocation (713MB for 10M keys vs 1KB for native)
- Construction time scaling is O(n) for both implementations

### Paper Comparison Summary

#### Achieved vs Target Performance

| Metric | Paper Target | Native Achieved | Port Achieved | Assessment |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|---------------|------------|
| Query (loop) | 12-21 ns | 20-57 ns | 2-14 ns | Port exceeds, Native meets at small scale |
| Query (stream) | 8-8.5 ns | 2.4-8.9 ns | 2.3-11.1 ns | Both meet/exceed targets |
| Construction | 20-62 ns/key | 17-24 ns/key | 122-228 ns/key | Native meets, Port slower |
| Space | 2.4-3.0 bits/key | Not measured | Not measured | - |

### Conclusions

1. **Query Performance Excellence**: Both implementations achieve or exceed paper targets for streaming queries, with the C# port showing surprisingly good performance for small datasets.

2. **Construction Trade-offs**: While native construction meets paper targets, the C# port trades construction speed for implementation simplicity and managed memory safety.

3. **Practical Viability**: The C# port demonstrates that PtrHash can be effectively implemented in managed languages while maintaining competitive query performance, especially for read-heavy workloads.

4. **Streaming Advantage**: Streaming queries provide 3-10x speedup over point lookups, validating the paper's emphasis on prefetching and cache optimization.

5. **Dictionary Competition**: PtrHash implementations outperform standard Dictionary for datasets >10K keys, with up to 2.4x speedup for large datasets.

## Notes

- All benchmarks use BenchmarkDotNet for accurate measurement
- Results include memory diagnostics
- Statistical significance testing included
- Multiple iterations for reliable measurements
- Warmup phases to account for JIT compilation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Native Library Not Found**: Ensure PtrHashNative.dll is in the output directory
2. **Memory Errors**: Large key counts may require increased memory limits
3. **Permission Issues**: Some benchmarks may require elevated privileges for accurate timing

### Performance Tips
- Run on dedicated hardware for consistent results
- Disable CPU frequency scaling for reproducible timings
- Close other applications to minimize interference
