# PtrHash Benchmarks

This folder contains comprehensive performance benchmarks for the PtrHash minimal perfect hash function implementation, comparing both the native Rust interop version and the C# port against standard data structures.

## Overview

PtrHash is a minimal perfect hash function (MPHF) that maps n distinct keys to {0,...,n-1} bijectively. These benchmarks measure:
- Query throughput (lookups per second)
- Construction time
- Memory usage
- Comparison against standard Dictionary<TKey,TValue>

## Available Benchmarks

### 1. Interop vs Port Comparison (`interop-vs-port`)
**File**: `PtrHashInteropVsPortBenchmark.cs`

Compares the native Rust interop implementation against the C# port implementation:
- Native PtrHash point and stream lookups
- C# Port PtrHash point and stream lookups
- Uses FxHasher for consistent comparison

### 2. Dictionary Comparisons (`dictionaries`)
**File**: `PtrHashDictionariesVsDictionaryBenchmark.cs`

Compares PtrHash dictionary implementations against standard Dictionary:
- Standard Dictionary<ulong, ulong> (baseline)
- Native PtrHash dictionary with sentinel values
- C# Port PtrHash dictionary implementation

### 3. Construction Time (`construct`)
**File**: `ConstructionBenchmark.cs`

Measures construction time for building PtrHash instances across different sizes.

### 4. Prefetch Performance (`prefetch`)
**File**: `PrefetchBenchmark.cs`

Tests the effectiveness of prefetching for memory-bound operations.
